# Pollen-Classification
The goal was to use techniques of Deep Learning and Machine Learning for Classification of Pollen in Novi Sad area.
Real-Time Airborne Particle Identifier Rapid-E from Plair SA is designed for real-time sampling and analysis of airborne particles. Compared to its predecessor PA-300 it delivers full time-resolved 24-angle scattering of near-UV laser beam, deep-UV laser-induced fluorescence in 32 measuring channels within a spectral range of 350â€“800 nm, eight sequential acquisitions with 500 ns retention and lifetime fluorescence at four spectral bands: 350-400, 420-460, 511-572, 672-800 and 2 ns temporal resolution. Recent studies indicate the use of flow cytometry has the potential for identification of bioaerosols , but dealing with a huge amount of diverse data makes AI method of choice for analysis.
Data are packed into csv files containing scattered light, fluorescence spectrum and lifetime of fluorescence signals for every sampled particle, additional features from scattering and lifetime data are also available.
